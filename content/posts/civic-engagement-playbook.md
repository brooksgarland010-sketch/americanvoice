Civic participation should be accessible, especially for people balancing work, school, and family. The goal is to make engagement sustainable, not overwhelming.

## A weekly cadence

- One community touchpoint each week.
- A monthly check-in on priority issues.

## Keep it evidence-first

Look for primary sources, public records, and the outcomes that follow. Consistency beats intensity.
